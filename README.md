# Graph_Transformer
A pytorch implementation of Graph Transformer for node classification.

Our implementation is based on "Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation" (NeurIPS'21) [[paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f1c1592588411002af340cbaedd6fc33-Abstract.html) [[github]] (https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer) and "Gophormer: Ego-Graph Transformer for Node Classification" [[arxiv]] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13094)
## Run the code  
Use preprocess_data.py for data preprocessing
Use start.sh to train the graph transformer
